Subject: [PATCH 52/52] Fixed Apache Benchmark tool timeout issue

Description:
EIP 752081 - [OT0.2] [Archercity]Performnace test via Ab_tool getting timeout error for KeepAlive=true in both basic and session auth

Root Cause:

Ab tool is using the HTTP 1.0 version to make the http requests.
BmcWeb is using the HTTP 1.1 version. When ab tool makeing the http
request with keep alive enabled, bmcweb is not closing the connection
request but ab tool is waiting for the connection to close.

Due to that timeout is happaned.

Fix:

Handled to close the keep alive request from HTTP 1.0 version after
the request is completed.
